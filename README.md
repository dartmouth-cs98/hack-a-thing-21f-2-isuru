# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

This project attempted to build a functional chatbot that could respond to medical questions. Requests and responses are pre-recorded in the intens.json file and forms the corpus of this project.

### How it works?

Each object in the intents.json file consists of potential questions that a user may ask and a group of responses to those questions that is grouped under a theme.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the following tutorial: https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/
I had some experience in Python and machine learning so some of the code was done based on my intuition. However, I was guided by the tutorial and the code for the GUI is from the tutorial.
